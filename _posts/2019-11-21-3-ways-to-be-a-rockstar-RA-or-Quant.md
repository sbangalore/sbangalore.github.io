You are a research assistant or quant or want to be one. (Or you’re just interested in a quick-start guide for quantitative finance – whatever rocks your boat!)

To be a successful RA requires an (1) _aptitude for detail_, (2) _strong communication skills_, and a (3) _technical background_. This quick-start guide will teach you how to do all 3.

<span style="color:blue">_How to develop an aptitude for detail_</span>

- Before submitting anything to a researcher or senior, get it verified by a colleague.
- For presentations and writing, make a print out; take a red pen and ink out any mistakes by hand.
- For code, make sure the code is up to spec: docstrings, function names, variables, and that the code works! Check your data and aggregates (make some graphs). I.e. having a GDP of 10 B for Canada does not makes sense.
- Quote more time than you estimate and use it to double check your work.
- If it’s a longer project, brute-force first then make it efficient.

There are a few papers and short books that are important to read.

- [Strunk and White (2009) _The Elements of Style_](http://www.jlakes.org/ch/web/The-elements-of-style.pdf)
- [Truss (2003) _Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation_](http://93.174.95.29/main/262000/9b1d0d6204c8718782759d24f98fa9a2/LYNNE%20TRUSS%20-%20EATS%2C%20SHOOTS%20%26%20LEAVES_%20WHY%2C%20COMMAS%20REALLY%20DO%20MAKE%20A%20DIFFERENCE%21-PROFILE%20BOOKS%20LTD%20%282006%29.pdf)
- [Zinsser (2006) _On Writing Well_](http://richardcolby.net/writ2000/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/On-Writing-Well-30th-Anniversa-Zinsser-William.pdf)
- [Miller (2004) _The Chicago Guide to Writing about Numbers_](http://93.174.95.29/main/479000/cf0ec8e2dd48f17fe28f248747dd6d2d/Jane%20E.%20Miller%20-%20The%20Chicago%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20about%20Numbers%20%28Chicago%20Guides%20to%20Writing%2C%20Editing%2C%20and%20Publishing%29%20%282004%29.pdf)
- [Higham (1998) _Handbook of Writing for the Mathematical Sciences_](http://93.174.95.29/main/274000/c2358571c7443872a9db30bd298a4765/Nicholas%20J.%20Higham%20-%20Handbook%20of%20Writing%20for%20the%20Mathematical%20Sciences-Society%20for%20Industrial%20and%20Applied%20Mathematics%20%281998%29.pdf)

The main points from these books will be summarized in a future discussion.

  <span style="color:blue">_How to get a technical background_</span>

There are a few essential programming languages, data structures, and algorithms that you should know. Here, I link the discussion and cheatsheet to each:

- [Linux/UNIX](https://sbangalore.github.io/cheatsheet-for-unix-commands/)
- Python
- Java
- STATA
- C++
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Statistics
- (Optional) Machine Learning
- (Optional) [Quick Mathematics](http://tradermaths.com/) -- for this, I link you to an external application. I recommend doing this every day until you can answer all 80 questions in 8 minutes with no mistakes.


**This is a lot of work but developing these essentials: conscientousness, clarity, and quantiative strength, will set you up for professional success.**
