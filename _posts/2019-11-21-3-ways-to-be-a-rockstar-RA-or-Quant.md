Hello! You are here because you are a research assistant or quant or want to be one. (Or you’re just interested in a quick-start guide for quantitative finance – whatever rocks your boat!)

To be a successful RA requires an (1) aptitude for detail, (2) strong communication skills, and a (3) technical background. This quick-start guide will teach you how to do all 3.

1. How to develop an aptitude for detail
To be on top of detail, there are a few steps that I have taken.
- Before submitting anything to a researcher or senior, get it verified by a colleague.
- For presentations and writing, make a print out; take a red pen and ink out any mistakes by hand.
- For code, make sure the code is up to spec: docstrings, function names, variables, and that the code works! Check your data and aggregates (make some graphs). I.e. having a GDP of 10 B for Canada does not makes sense.
- Quote more time than you estimate and use it to double check your work.
- If it’s a longer project, brute-force first then make it efficient.
