I first read _On Writing Well_ as part of a university course on business writing. I enjoyed it so much that I continue to read it on an annual basis. It's a breath of fresh air and inspires me to write with simplicity and style.

## Review
_On Writing Well_ outlines principles on skillful writing focused around pithiness and style.

The principles should be used in context. _On Writing Well_ advocates for simplicity first. In personal situations, it may be in your interest to be tactful.

## Summary
I cover part 1, 2, and 4 of the book. Part 3 is involved with forms individual to each writer, such as journalism and business writing.

### The Principles

_Simplicity_

Write simply, without unnecessary words, circular references, and jargon. Ask yourself:
1. What am I trying to say? 
2. Is it clear to someone reading this for the first time? 
3. Can I remove or change words to express the same meaning with less complexity?

_Style_

On style, relax and have confidence. Master the basics then remove the unnecessary. Then, once you are comfortable, express yourself. Believe in your ego.

_Words_

Words have meaning. Think about their message.
1. Does that message makes sense?
2. Do the words sound good together?
3. Does the message harmonize with the others, in tense, style, attitude, and tone?
4. How much is covered and to what degree?

_The beginning and the end_

You have 8 seconds to get someone's attention. How do you do it? Freshness, novelty, shock, humour, or paradox all work well. Then, you have to keep them guessing about what's next. Learn more than you need, from sources relevant, and sources not immediately relevant. Consider it material to evoke emotion.

On that note, end shortly and with emotion: a quotation often works well.

_Generalizations_

1. Use active verbs;
2. Limit adverbs and adjectives;
3. Prune small words (“a bit,” “a littl`e,” “sort of,” “kind of,” “rather,” “quite,” “very,” “too,” “pretty much,” “in a sense”);
4. Use more periods. Use fewer exclamations.
5. But _is_ useful at the start of a sentence.
6. That > Which -- most of the time.
7. People are relatable. Get people doing things.

_Eloquence_

Finesse is developed through the study and practice of experienced writers. For example, in Lincoln's second inauguration speech, you can note his study of the bible and the simplicity of his words, few of which are more than one syllable. His pithy and abrahamic style instilled a feeling of reverence within me.

I hope this proved helpful to your writing.
