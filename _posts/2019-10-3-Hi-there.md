This is my website to contact/reach me. You can see (or maybe even read) my writing on financial, tech, and other perspectives here.

I'm currently an RA at the [Bank of Canada](https://www.bankofcanada.ca "Where I work!").

I'm also a CS masters student at the [University of Texas](https://www.bankofcanada.ca "Where I study!").

I enjoy reading **books and papers**. Here are some I've read recently!

- [Browder, Red Notice](https://www.amazon.ca/Red-Notice-Finance-Murder-Justice/dp/147675571X)
- [Goodfellow, Deep Learning](https://www.amazon.ca/Deep-Learning-Ian-Goodfellow/dp/0262035618)
- [Shwartz and David, Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.ca/Understanding-Machine-Learning-Theory-Algorithms/dp/1107057132/)
- [Paarsh and Golyaev, A Gentle Introduction to Effective Computing in Quantitative Research](https://www.amazon.ca/Introduction-Effective-Computing-Quantitative-Research/dp/0262034115)

Here's what I'm reading now to learn more about real analysis.

- Started here: [Abbot, Understanding Analysis](https://elliespathtostatistics.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/abbott-second-edition.pdf) 
- Next here: [Rudin, Principles of Mathematical Analysis](https://notendur.hi.is/vae11/%C3%9Eekking/principles_of_mathematical_analysis_walter_rudin.pdf)
- A little bit here: [Tao, Analysis I](https://github.com/WMX567/Math-learning/blob/master/Analysis%20I%20Terence%20Tao.pdf)
- Then finally, here: [Tao, Analysis II](https://github.com/WMX567/Math-learning/blob/master/Analysis%20I%20Terence%20Tao.pdf)


I'm a **foodie**. But then again, who isn't?? See some of the ones I have recently enjoyed below.
