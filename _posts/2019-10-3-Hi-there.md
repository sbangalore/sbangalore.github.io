This is my website to contact/reach me. You can see (or maybe even read) my writing on financial, tech, and other perspectives here.

I'm currently an RA at the [Bank of Canada](https://www.bankofcanada.ca "Where I work!").

I'm also a CS masters student at the [University of Texas](https://www.bankofcanada.ca "Where I study!").

I enjoy reading **books and papers**. Here are the some I've read recently!

- Red Notice
- Deep Learning (Ian Goodfellow)
- Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms
- A Gentle Introduction to Effective Computing in Quantitative Research

I'm a **foodie**. But then again, who isn't?? See some of the ones I have recently enjoyed below.

- Eataly Toronto
- Rasa Toronto
- Butter Baker Toronto
- Amelie NYC
