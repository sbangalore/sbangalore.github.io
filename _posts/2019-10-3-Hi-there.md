This is my website to contact/reach me. You can see (or maybe even read) my writing on financial, tech, and other perspectives here.

I'm currently an RA at the [Bank of Canada](https://www.bankofcanada.ca "Where I work!").

I'm also a CS masters student at the [University of Texas](https://www.bankofcanada.ca "Where I study!").

I enjoy reading **books and papers**. Here are some I've read recently!

- Red Notice
- Deep Learning (Ian Goodfellow)
- Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms
- A Gentle Introduction to Effective Computing in Quantitative Research

Here's what I'm reading now.

- [Rudin, Principles of Mathematical Analysis](https://notendur.hi.is/vae11/%C3%9Eekking/principles_of_mathematical_analysis_walter_rudin.pdf) :neckbeard:

I'm a **foodie**. But then again, who isn't?? See some of the ones I have recently enjoyed below.
