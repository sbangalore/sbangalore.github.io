I discuss my 30 day journey where I work on improving my calculation speed through [Trader Maths](http://tradermaths.com/tradermath/).

This was an effort to improve my calculation speed. Throughout these exercises, I played loud music. See a nice album here: [Guardians of the Galaxy Awesome Mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCT50t-JAMw). I set the exercises to ask 80 questions on floats with a mix of + , - , / , * , a maximum of 2 digits, and 2 decimal points.

| Day | Total Attempted | Correct | Incorrect | Score |
|-----|-----------------|---------|-----------|-------|
| 1   | 56              | 46      | 10        | 36    |
| 2   | 41              | 31      | 10        | 11    |
| 2   | 32              | 30      | 02        | 26    |
