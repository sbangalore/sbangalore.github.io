I discuss my 30 day journey where I work on improving my calculation speed through [Trader Maths](http://tradermaths.com/tradermath/).

| Day | Total Attempted | Correct | Incorrect | Score |
|-----|-----------------|---------|-----------|-------|
| 1   | 56              | 46      | 10        | 36    |

**Day 1 mistakes**

-47*-0.13 = 5.11 | 6.11
-96*4.5 = -43.2 | -432
9.9*0.2 = 19.8 | 1.98
0.27/0.3 = 9 | 0.9
0.52-2 = 1.48 | -1.48

In day 1, I wanted to focus on reducing the # of mistakes in my calculations. I found that >80% of these mistakes were based on decimal placement. In the next couple of days, I focused on looking at the general magnitude (negative/positive and # of places) before submitting.
