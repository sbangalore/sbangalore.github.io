I discuss my 30 day journey where I double my calculation speed and improve my calculation accuracy by 50% with [Trader Maths](http://tradermaths.com/tradermath/).

# Mental math's important

Every been on a table with somebody who, when you said, let's split the $24.56 pizza 4 ways, could run the math in their head to quickly get to $6.14?

We do mental math everyday, from calculating tips to splitting cash between our friends. Mental math tests are also prevalent in quant finance, technology, and trading tests with firms like **Optiver**, **McKinsey**, and **Goldman Sachs**. It's important to get your numbers quick and right. That's why I wrote this post.

# How I doubled my speed

This was an effort to improve my mental math (the number of math questions correctly solved in a certain amount of time.)

To do so, I did exercises on [Trader Maths](http://tradermaths.com/tradermath/), an online quizzing platform. I started the exercises to ask 80 questions on floats with a mix of + , - , / , * , a maximum of 2 digits, and 2 decimal points. Once I hit 72/80+ (90%+) constantly, I increased the calculations to 3 digits and 3 decimal points. Throughout these exercises, I played loud music. See a nice album here: [Guardians of the Galaxy Awesome Mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCT50t-JAMw).

_note: the platform deducts a point if you don't add a 0 in front of a decimal answer_

| 13  | 68              | 66      | 04        | 62    | 1      |

At this point, I increased the difficulty to 3 decimal points and 3 digits.

# Some tips

I made a few incremental speed ups from:

1. **Double checking**: after calculations, look at the negatives and magnitudes (this should take 1/2 second)
2. **Using tricks**: for example, when multiplying by 11, add the digits of the number and put them in the middle. i.e. for 11 * 23, the answer is 2 (3+2) 3 = 253
3. **Guessing well**: the product of a number should always be the units digit of the factors multiplied.
	i.e. 34343 * 340128 must have 4 at the end of the answer, because 3 * 8 = 24
