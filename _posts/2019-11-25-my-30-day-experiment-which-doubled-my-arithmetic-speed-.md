I discuss my 30 day journey where I double my calculation speed and improve my calculation accuracy by 50% with [Trader Maths](http://tradermaths.com/tradermath/).

This was an effort to improve my mental math (the number of math questions correctly solved in a certain amount of time.) Throughout these exercises, I played loud music. See a nice album here: [Guardians of the Galaxy Awesome Mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCT50t-JAMw). I set the exercises to ask 80 questions on floats with a mix of + , - , / , * , a maximum of 2 digits, and 2 decimal points.

I made a few incremental speed ups from:

1. **Double checking**: after calculations, look at the negatives and magnitudes (this should take 1/2 second)
2. **Using tricks**: for example, when multiplying by 11, add the digits of the number and put them in the middle. i.e. for 11 * 23, the answer is 2 (3+2) 3 = 253
3. **Guessing well**: the product of a number should always be the units digit of the factors multiplied.
	i.e. 34343 * 340128 must have 4 at the end of the answer, because 3 * 8 = 24
