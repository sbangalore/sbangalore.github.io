A bond is a security that provides a fixed stream of income to the lender. I discuss the factors behind government bond valuation.

Government bonds can encompass a wide range of instruments. Such securities are issued at a discount to face value and are used to set the benchmark. Their prices are driven by factors such as:

1. **Time to maturity**: the time to maturity of the bond: days between the maturity and issuance date.

2. **Duration**: the duration of the bond: how a % change in interest rates affects price calculated by the
weighted average of cash flows.

3. **Convexity**: the change in the duration of the bond as interest rates change calculated as the derivative of duration.

4. **Liquidity**: the amount of trading activity in the market for the bond. measured in a variety of ways, such as amihud, rolling volume, and bid-ask spread.

5. **Issuer credit quality**: how likely the creditor is to default measured through ways such as Moodyâ€™s, S&P, Fitch, DBRS, CDS spreads.

6. **Seniority and collateral**: how senior the bond is in the debt tranche of the issuer and what is the
collateral (i.e. taxing power vs. debenture.) This is usually the former.

7. **Coupon**: what is the coupon, when do these coupons get issued, and how often they get issued.

8. **Settlement date**: when is the trade settled (this will determine if and how much of the coupons will be priced in.)

9. **Embedded options**: call, put, convert or other such options embedded within the bond structure. These
are rare in government bonds.

Prices in government bonds are efficient relative to other markets, however, there are limits to this efficiency. With the same issuer quality, time to maturity, and duration, there are opportunities to profit through the liquidity premium. 

**Government guaranteed bonds** CMHC bonds, guaranteed by the Government of Canada, trade at significantly
lower price (higher yield) than Government of Canada bonds. Purchasing CMHC bonds and shorting the
Canadian government at the same duration, convexity, and time to maturity can capture yield gain.

**Butterfly trading** based on relative value of similar bonds with the same duration and convexity (buying the higher yielding bond and selling the lower yielding bond) until one year has passed. This strategy is referenced in Fontaine, Nolin 2017. It involves using a portfolio of three bonds to establish the relative value of a similar bond.

**Refinancing Risk** An asset-liability mismatch between the leverage used and convertible could result in a situation where this is no leverage available in a down credit market.

**Matching Risk**: The strategy involves approximately matching the convexity and cash flows of the portfolio of three bonds.

**Liquidity Risk**: Unwinding a position in convertibles is expensive due to the illiquidity that generates profit for the strategy so any overall decrease in portfolio assets could be compounded by a position in the less liquid bond.

Overall, the fixed income arbitrage strategy is valuable when held to maturity, however, caution should be
taken as similar risks to convertibles remain when held as a trading instrument, and fixed income markets
sometimes do not behave as indicated (for example, the United States is very different to Canada due to
issuance frequency.)
