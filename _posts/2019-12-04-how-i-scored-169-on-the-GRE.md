Today, I get you the fastest way to mint cash :sparkles: getting into HYPS

There is substance in this post, I promise. This is my four step process on how I made a 169/168/5 on the GRE. Here's the proof:

<span style="color:blue">How much time did I take?</span>

The best way to start is with time. I budgeted 30 days to get the 169 with 4 hours per day (approx ~120 hours.) Budget 2x this amount if you are not a native speaker, and 1.5x this amount if you are not comfortable with math. So if you are both, this would be ~350 hours. Follow that formula for all times mentioned hereforth.

This is how you use your time.

**Verbal**

During your daily activities when you have a couple of hours metally, spend them on the Magoosh Flashcards until you get all the cards correct on the first try. That will take at least 20 days and 2 hours per day. For me, this was when I was doing cardio/running, in the washroom, and on the way to work. If you're wondering about the running, I put my phone on the treadmill and swiped.

This is now 40 hours of verbal prep in 20 days. You will have a good understanding of the verbal section and should reach the high 150s/160s.

**Quant**

For math, I would recommend going through the MGMAT books if you are uncomfortable, or if you are relatively comfortable but making small mistakes, to start working on the Magoosh Math and Quant online. Do NOT run the questions sequentially. Instead, run practice tests purely on quant continuously in blocks of time, and analyze your mistakes afterwords in sections. For example, if you notice that combinatorics is a weak point, read it over in the MGMAT, and solve another practice test. Continue with this for 10 practice tests.

This will run you ~10 hours for a total of 50 hours of prep in 23 days. You will now have a good understanding of the quantiative section and should reach the high 150s/160s.

**AWA**

The optimal essay length is 600 words; this is pretty long. It is improtant to have clarity, conciseness, and be verbose (use long, useless words.) That's what the GRE likes :shrugs:. Get a rocking thesis, have an introduction, use transitions, three paragraphs with supporting arguments, and a conclusion that restates the thesis. Basically, do what you did when learning to write in middle school: a solid 5 paragraph essay. Use the prompts from the essay topics shown above.
  
You will spend ~10 hours on essay writing for a total of 60 hours of prep in 25 days. This should get you a 4.5+ score on the AWA. You will now have a week to get your practice exams on.
  
**Practice Exams**
  
This should be your workflow:
1. Get at least one practice exam done under exam circumstances (no distractions, music, etc.) Score it properly. This will give you an estimate of the score you might make.
2. If you haven't finished your Magoosh problems and reviewed them, finish and review them now. _Focus on getting your Magoosh questions done first._
3. Then, start working on 3-4 more exams, and review the problems you do not get correct.
  
You'll start to notice that some of the more obscure words are challenging. You'll have to take Ls on these; focus on the Pareto principle, and get the high frequency words correct.
  
You will spend the rest of your time ~60 hours here. This is real crunch time and it is important to put in the time.
  
  
**Day before exam**
  
- Get some sleep!!
- Take a banana and a bottle of water.
- Don't drink too much water.
  
Congrats, you now have your solid GRE score and, hopefully, are happy with it (:
