Here's the resume format I used to get offers at Goldman, Amazon, and more

## The Resume

### Resume Header

:point_right: Center the header, make sure your name is in bigger font than the rest (so they remember who you are), and write your address, phone number and email address right below that. Keep the address simple. You don't need to include your unit number

:warning: If in Europe, include your Photo, nationality, etc.

:warning: Never include your photo on your resume in North America.

### Education

:point_right: If you’re in university, this should be on top. If you're out of university for more than 2 years, work experience goes first. It should include:

1. School,
2. Major,
3. Graduation date,
4. GPA

:point_right: If you got a significant (10k+) scholarship/achievement, include it here.

:point_right: Include your GPA, **if** it's above 3.0. 

:point_right: If outside the US (i.e. in the UK, write “Earned 2.1 cumulative average.”), write your class rank/reported grade.

:warning: Don’t include high school unless you went to an Eton type school.

:warning: Don’t include clubs, activities, or certifications here.

### Work & Leadership Experience

:point_right: 2 to 4 major work experience entries. Think about what someone hiring you reading your resume would want to know – here are a few examples:

:point_right: You were in 4 clubs at school and also had an internship at Goldman Sachs (in any group). DO NOT write about each of these as if they were equal – Goldman Sachs is exponentially more important than your clubs, so spend half your resume on GS, pick the 2 activities where you contributed most, and write a few lines about each of them.

:point_right: If you’ve had absolutely no real internships or other work experience, you should still call this section “Work & Leadership Experience” to give the impression you did.


### Skills, Activities & Interests

:point_right: Keep this short and simple (2-5 lines). List interesting skills, like languages, technical skills (real ones, like programming languages), courses next, followed by a line or two on more minor Activities, and then your Interests at the end.

:point_right: When you’re picking your Interests try to list interesting Interests. Don’t just write “Running” – write that you “Competed in marathons in 13 countries across Europe and North America.”

:point_right: Even though this isn’t “work experience,” the same strategies hold true – be specific, focus on what’s memorable, and try to go in-depth with only a few areas rather than giving a laundry list with minimal details.

## The Structure

### How To Structure Each Entry

:point_right: Do a project-centric structure for each entry. Write based on what you _accomplished_.

:point_right: In each case, start out with a Summary Sentence stating what you did and the major results of your work (if you know them).

:point_right: Go into “Selected Project Experience” and put down what you accomplished. Focus on 1-3 projects max.

### How To Structure Resume Bullets

:point_right: Say, specifically, what you did. Numbers are good. I.e. improved efficiency by xx% by doing yz.

:point_right: Give the results of what you did – and yes, numbers are good, but even something qualitative is better than nothing. You should use “by” to separate each part.

## Passing the AI check (ATS)

There are often over 100+ job applicants to each job. Hiring teams use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to reduce this down to a manageable number. Examples include **Taleo** and **Greenhouse**. You need to pass this to get over the first round.

:point-right: ATS Friendly Resume Layout -- Use the layout described above with proper headings

:point-right: Use 1 column

Multi-column resumes are generally not very friendly to an ATS. Keep a 1 column resume for the ATS and a 2-column resume (if you want) when you’re sending it to a recruiter or manager directly.

:point-right: No Graphics and Clipart

:point-right: Font: 11/12 pt Arial/ Helvetica

:point-right: Bolded words and Bulleted Lists

Use **standard** round bullets throughout your application 

:point-right: No Tables or Special Characters

:point-right: .docx Format
